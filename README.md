# Tema 2 - Shopping Cart
Made a basic shopping cart, which uses vanilla JS, HTML and CSS.

It should be able to:
- show products information (name, description, price etc).
- Possible to add items to cart.
- Should be able to access the cart and see what the total price is.
- Possible to delete products from the cart.

Was able to achieve most of these, I'd like to add it so you could choose how many items you'd like to remove from the cart, instead of having it delete all of said item.
